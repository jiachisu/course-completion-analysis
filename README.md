#  Course Completion Behavior Analysis
*Data-driven insights to improve learning engagement and course success outcomes*

---

##  Project Overview
Online education platforms face a major challenge — **a high percentage of learners register for courses but do not complete them**, impacting:

- Revenue recognition  
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)  
- Retention and engagement metrics  
- Personalization and course recommendations  

This project analyzes **100,000 learner activity records** to identify behavioral patterns and suggest **data-backed strategies** that can improve course completion rates and learning experience.

##  Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tools |
|----------|------|
| Programming | Python (pandas, numpy) |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| Notebook | Jupyter |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |

---

##  Key Metrics Evaluated (KPIs)

| KPI | Why it matters |
|-----|----------------|
| Completion Rate | Primary measure of platform success |
| Login Frequency | Indicates engagement level |
| Session Duration | Measures depth of learning |
| Assignment Submission | Best predictor of completion |
| Quiz Scores | Knowledge retention indicator |
| Rewatch Count | Shows difficulty understanding |
| Satisfaction Rating | Captures user perception |

---

##  Insights (High-Level Summary)

- **Higher login frequency** strongly correlates with successful completion.  
- **Assignment submission behavior** predicts completion more than quiz scores.  
- **Mobile users underperform**, signaling UX limitations.  
- **Higher-educated learners complete more frequently**, suggesting tailored onboarding for others.  
- Rewatch behavior reveals topics that require content redesign or summaries.
